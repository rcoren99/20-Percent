# Proposal: Password Safe
## An application to help protect passwords from theft and forgetfullness

## Needs and Opportunities
Have you ever tried to log in to a webpage or service only to realize that you can't remember you password? Sure, you could hit the "Forgot password" button, but some logins don't have one and many are complicated and require you to jump through several hoops to reset your password. 

## Audience / Clients / Users
Anyone with many complex passwords would benefit from a memory not as failable as the human brain. Perenial forgetters like my father, who inspired this project, will also find this useful, no matter how many passwords they have or how complex the passwords are.

## Product
The final product will be a downloadable desktop application that not only remembers and protects passwords, but is also pleasing to the eye. Users would only have to remember one password (to access their other passwords) instead of five or ten. This would also allow users to create more unique passwords, increasing safety across all of their accounts. Inside the application, users could search by service (e.g. Google, Facebook, Instagram), username (e.g. jane.doe123), or category (e.g. email, banking, social media). There would also be a button that would copy the whole password to the clipboard when clicked. An "Add Password" button would take users to screen where they could input the name of the service, username, password, a category, and comments.

## Timeline

| Date          | Deliverable                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| February 26   | Basic framework for the storage of passwords |
| April 1       | Appearance finished                          |
| April 29      | Final product including safety features      |

## Reality Check
I would like to make the place that the passwords are stored as secure as possible, which I believe would require encryptions, and while I know how encryptions work, I know nothing about how to actually encrypt something. I would need to learn this. There is a possiblility of adding cloud storage for passwords so a user can access their passwords on more than one device. I have even less knowledge about how to do this than I do about encryptions. I would also need to learn how to add graphics to my application.

## Conclusion
While the functionality I want can be achieved on many web browsers and even in Microsoft Excel, a dedicated application would be more simple and intuitive to use for those who are not as tech savvy. In the end, if the user's life is made easier and less stressful because they don't have to constantly reset passwords they've forgotten, my objective is achieved.
