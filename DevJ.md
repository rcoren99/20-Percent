I was gone on Friday, but I did do research during the week on encryptions. I found out htat I will probably have to download a thing to help encrypt my program. Otherwise, I don't really know how to make a desktop app. Learning how to do this will be my next step.

Peace Out,

##Week 2
2/13/16

This week, I researched how to make frames in Java! I read Java tutorials at the url https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/frame.html. This has instructions on how to make the frame, add components like text fields, radio buttons, password fields, change the visual appearance of the frame, and much more. The website even had a java class that you cound download that makes a window that says "HappyWorld". This in particular was very helpful, because you could see exactly what was going on code-wise. One thing I noticed was that this website only had instructions for three appearance themes, all of which were Windows XP style. I am wondering if there are other ways I can find different themes to make my application look pretty, which is one of my goals. Overall, I am for sure headed in the right direction. Next week, I hope to read through all of the relevant material on the website I found and clearly form a vision for my application.

Hasta la Vista,
