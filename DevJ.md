##Week 1
2/9/16

I was gone on Friday, but I did do research during the week on encryptions. I found out htat I will probably have to download a thing to help encrypt my program. Otherwise, I don't really know how to make a desktop app. Learning how to do this will be my next step.

Peace Out,

##Week 2
2/13/16

This week, I researched how to make frames in Java! I read Java tutorials at the url https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/frame.html. This has instructions on how to make the frame, add components like text fields, radio buttons, password fields, change the visual appearance of the frame, and much more. The website even had a java class that you cound download that makes a window that says "HappyWorld". This in particular was very helpful, because you could see exactly what was going on code-wise. One thing I noticed was that this website only had instructions for three appearance themes, all of which were Windows XP style. I am wondering if there are other ways I can find different themes to make my application look pretty, which is one of my goals. Overall, I am for sure headed in the right direction. Next week, I hope to read through all of the relevant material on the website I found and clearly form a vision for my application.

Hasta la Vista,

##Week 3
2/21/16

I made a window appear!!! Hurray to small accomplishments. I also made a Password class with parameters for service, username, category, password, and comments. These will be the fields that the user can fill out to be able to sort, filter, and search their list of passwords. I have been doing more research into making a window, and its all very confusing. There are so many layers and things that you can add that it's a little overwhelming. However, I hope to have the basic window complete by Friday for the check point thing. I was really excited to see that they have password fields and text fields along with menu bars, and that everything is customization by color and size. I also figured out that the frame will take the appearance of whatever operating system in which the window is opened. I hope to be an expert at adding components by the end of this coming week!

See ya round like a donut,

##Week 4
2/28/16

This week was very difficult. I had lots of problems figuring out how layouts work for components and how to make the components themselves do what I need them to do. I did make the classes necessary to create and store passwords on the inside of the code. However, the outside is far from finished. I need to figure out how to change the screen when the user needs to be directed to a different one. Currently, when a button is pressed that would do this, a new window appears instead. I also need to finish the GUI for each of the other screens that the application will need. For now, I have made good headway in laying out basic components, however, I anticipate problems when it comes to integrating the password storage system with the interface. Hopefully, the coding will become easier as my understanding of Swing components grows.

Smooth sailing,
Rachel

##Week 5
3/6/16

Is it really week five already? Time flies when you have to fix every one of your 1980329875034850298 spelling mistakes every time you compile.
I feel as though I have finally figured Swing out this week. I can nest JPanels like a pro and now the screens switch without making a new JFrame every single time (CardLayout was the solution). I have also found that the explanations on the webpage generally suck, but the code from the example programs is really helpful. Don't really want to read their 5 paragraph explanations? Just copy the code into a new BlueJ class, run the program, look at the code, and BOOM you have all the knowledge. In all honesty, I am feeling more optimistic that I will complete this in time. My problem for next week is to store the data (passwords and such) without it resetting itself every time I run the program.

Wish me luck,
Rachel

##Week 6
3/19/16

I have been hard at work adding new screens and connecting all of my JButtons to action events this week. I made a new screen for settings. This will enable users to change the name that is displayed on the main screen and the main password that unlocks the safe. The settings button on the main screen connects the settings screen to everything else, and "done" and "cancel" buttons save or discard the changes. One thing I am experimenting with in the settings screen is popup screens. In the settings screen, there are buttons for changing the name or main password. I want to make a separate screen pop up when either of those buttons are clicked, because there would only be one text field, an "ok" button, and a "cancel" button. My decision to do this factors into the appearance on the safe, because such a small amount of components would look weird on a full size screen. This coming week I will finish this and hopefully complete all of the screens and connect all of the JButtons.

Thank God for Spring Break,
Rachel
