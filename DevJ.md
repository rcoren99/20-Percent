##Week 1
2/9/16

I was gone on Friday, but I did do research during the week on encryptions. I found out htat I will probably have to download a thing to help encrypt my program. Otherwise, I don't really know how to make a desktop app. Learning how to do this will be my next step.

Peace Out,

##Week 2
2/13/16

This week, I researched how to make frames in Java! I read Java tutorials at the url https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/frame.html. This has instructions on how to make the frame, add components like text fields, radio buttons, password fields, change the visual appearance of the frame, and much more. The website even had a java class that you cound download that makes a window that says "HappyWorld". This in particular was very helpful, because you could see exactly what was going on code-wise. One thing I noticed was that this website only had instructions for three appearance themes, all of which were Windows XP style. I am wondering if there are other ways I can find different themes to make my application look pretty, which is one of my goals. Overall, I am for sure headed in the right direction. Next week, I hope to read through all of the relevant material on the website I found and clearly form a vision for my application.

Hasta la Vista,

##Week 3
2/21/16

I made a window appear!!! Hurray to small accomplishments. I also made a Password class with parameters for service, username, category, password, and comments. These will be the fields that the user can fill out to be able to sort, filter, and search their list of passwords. I have been doing more research into making a window, and its all very confusing. There are so many layers and things that you can add that it's a little overwhelming. However, I hope to have the basic window complete by Friday for the check point thing. I was really excited to see that they have password fields and text fields along with menu bars, and that everything is customization by color and size. I also figured out that the frame will take the appearance of whatever operating system in which the window is opened. I hope to be an expert at adding components by the end of this coming week!

See ya round like a donut,

##Week 4
2/28/16

This week was very difficult. I had lots of problems figuring out how layouts work for components and how to make the components themselves do what I need them to do. I did make the classes necessary to create and store passwords on the inside of the code. However, the outside is far from finished. I need to figure out how to change the screen when the user needs to be directed to a different one. Currently, when a button is pressed that would do this, a new window appears instead. I also need to finish the GUI for each of the other screens that the application will need. For now, I have made good headway in laying out basic components, however, I anticipate problems when it comes to integrating the password storage system with the interface. Hopefully, the coding will become easier as my understanding of Swing components grows.

Smooth sailing,
Rachel
